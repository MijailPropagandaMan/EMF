First, we're removing a vast bulk of EMF features from the mod in the hopes of achieving a crash-free version
of EMF. Then, the intention is to rapidly add features back into the mix, test for crashes, rinse, and repeat
until crashes are encountered by something added. From there, significantly more drill-down will be necessary,
but this is the best plan that I've got at this point.

( This document is very WIP and will be updating fairly rapidly. )

====== AHAB XI ======

Removal / disable log (in addition to previous version):
- fully out-commented emf_new_character[_baby]
- EMF/history/titles (sans e_hip.txt)
- common/societies
- common/religion_modifiers

- [E+V-focused] landed title & other various references to custom religions or orders, ismaili->shiite

- emf_ai_wrong_religion_liege decision
- emf_vanilla.10
- reran religion_codegen.py & revolt_codegen.py
- emf_holy_order_triggers

Results:
--------
Observe made it from 1066 to 1087 on E+V before it crashed (didn't bother with debugger -- not too useful at
this point).

Temporarily re-added DLCs of M&M, JD, and Conclave on same build:

Observe made it from 1066 to 1091 on E+V before it crashed (no debugger).


====== AHAB XII ======

Removal / disable log (in addition to previous version):
- common
- events
- decisions
- history/titles (e_hip)
- history/characters (isis)
- E+V/.../common

Addition / re-enable log:
- DLCs:
  + Jade Dragon
  + Monks & Mystics
  + Conclave

Note that Charlemagne DLC is still disabled. For this test, it doesn't matter, but EMF code assumes that there
are no vanilla-style viceroyalty titles in the game (due to imperial government supplanting it), so when this
hopefully succeeds at failing to crash, we'll still want it disabled as we put things back together.

Results:
--------
Observe made it from 1066 to 1217 (151 years) on E+V before it was terminated gracefully by Captain Ahab.


====== AHAB XIII ======

First, we revert all of the deletions from the previous version, and then:

Removal / disable log (after revert of Ahab XII):
- events/
  + emf_builder_events
  + emf_culture
  + emf_disease
  + emf_prisoner
- decisions/
  + emf_elective_decisions
  + emf_faction_decisions
  + emf_formation(_map)?_decisions
  + emf_prisoner_decisions
  + emf_vassal_transfer_decisions
- common/
  + defines/
  + artifact_spawns/
  + artifacts/
  + council_positions/
  + council_voting/

Results:
--------
Observe made it from 1066 to 1186 (120 years) on E+V before it was gracefully terminated by Captain Ahab.


====== AHAB XIV ======

Addition / re-enable log:
- events/
  + emf_builder_events
  + emf_culture
- decisions/
  + emf_elective_decisions
  + emf_faction_decisions
  + emf_formation(_map)?_decisions
  + emf_vassal_transfer_decisions
- common/
  + artifact_spawns/
  + artifacts/
  + council_positions/
  + council_voting/

Results:
--------
Observe made it from 1066 to 1224 (158 years) on E+V before it was gracefully terminated by Captain Ahab.


====== AHAB XV ======

Addition / re-enable log:
- common/
  + defines/

NOTE: Since the removals of Ahab XIII and the additions of Ahab XIV, these other files remain disabled since
Ahab XI (the last crash iteration before our first no-crash iteration):
- events/
  + emf_disease
  + emf_prisoner
- decisions/
  + emf_prisoner_decisions

Results:
--------
Observe made it from 1066 to 1101 (35 years) on E+V before crashing.


====== AHAB XVI ======

It appears that a define is causing at least one crash, we conclude from the results of Ahab XV. Thus, we must
eliminate overridden defines until we do not crash.

Define override removal log:
- NCouncil.*
- NInfamy
  + VASSAL_CHANGE_VALUE
- NCharacter
  + ASSIGN_ACTION_DAYS
  + NON_AGGRESSION_PACT_BLOCKS_FACTIONS
  + INFANT_DEATH_CHANCE
- NTitle
  + CROWN_LAW_CHANGE_TIMER
  + EMPIRE_DE_JURE_ASSIMILATION_YEARS
- NEconomy.*
- NMilitary.*
- NAI
  + TRIBAL_VASSAL_EXTRA_CALL_CHANCE = 0 (the older 30 version is still there a few lines above apparently)
- NRulerDesigner.*

Results:
--------
Observe made it from 1066 to 1174 (108 years) on E+V before it was gracefully terminated by Captain Ahab.


====== AHAB XVII ======

Define override re-enable log:
- NCouncil.* (see note about REGENCY_VOTING below)
- NInfamy
  + VASSAL_CHANGE_VALUE
- NCharacter
  + ASSIGN_ACTION_DAYS
- NTitle
  + CROWN_LAW_CHANGE_TIMER
- NEconomy.*
- NMilitary.*
- NRulerDesigner.*

Since NCouncil.REGENCY_VOTING contained the names of decisions which are not currently defined for the last
several iterations, I removed all those references which are not currently defined to be safe:

lollard_revoke_temple
emf_prisoner_house_arrest
emf_prisoner_oubliette
emf_prisoner_dungeon
emf_prisoner_castration
emf_prisoner_blinding
emf_prisoner_zun_judgement
kharijite_public_execution

Results:
--------
Observe made it from 1066 to 1191 (125 years) on E+V before it was gracefully terminated by Captain Ahab.


====== AHAB XVIII ======

Define override re-enable log:
- NCharacter.NON_AGGRESSION_PACT_BLOCKS_FACTIONS (should be unused by the code since they turned it into a game rule)
- NCharacter.INFANT_DEATH_CHANCE

If this doesn't crash, I can only see 3 possible conclusions:

- NAI.TRIBAL_VASSAL_EXTRA_CALL_CHANCE shouldn't be 0, OR it leads to UB if you assign to the same define
twice in the same LUA file for CK2 defines.

- NTitle.EMPIRE_DE_JURE_ASSIMILATION_YEARS not being equal (specifically, less) than king-tier

- The whole defines tangent was a false positive due to NCouncil.REGENCY_VOTING having contained undefined
decision names until the previous iteration. In this case, we rollback & drill into emf_prisoner_decisions and
such.

Results:
--------
Observe made it from 1066 to 1096 (30 years) on E+V before it crashed.


====== AHAB XIX ======

Define override removal log:
- NCharacter.INFANT_DEATH_CHANCE

Define override re-enable log:
- NCharacter.NON_AGGRESSION_PACT_BLOCKS_FACTIONS (should be unused by the code since they turned it into a game rule -- want to remove it right now, but Science First?)
- NAI.TRIBAL_VASSAL_EXTRA_CALL_CHANCE = 0 (and removing the override with 30 currently there as well)
- NTitle.EMPIRE_DE_JURE_ASSIMILATION_YEARS

Results:
--------
Observe made it from 1066 to 1188 (122 years) on E+V before it was gracefully terminated by Captain Ahab.

Ahab XIX, which didn't crash, was a full reversal of the out-comments in defines from XVIII, which gives us
very strong evidence that allowing stillborns in EMF is at least one source of the crashes on CK2 v3.3.0
(64-bit) and also concludes our foray into define-related crashing for now.


====== AHAB XX ======

For this trial, we temporarily revert to the commit prior to Ahab I (commit tag: v10.4), i.e., the baseline
commit for this isolation testing. I'll not literally revert in _this_ Ahab commit but simply test upon a
modified version of that one. The goal is to see if our INFANT_DEATH_CHANCE crash lead from Ahab XIX is the
only crash source on 64-bit. The hope is that this run will NOT crash.

Define override removal log:
- NCharacter.INFANT_DEATH_CHANCE

DLC addition / re-enable log:
- Charlemagne (only one disabled for last several iterations)

Results:
--------
Observe made it from 1066 to 1255 (189 years) on E+V before riding off victoriously into the Alt+F4 sunset.
