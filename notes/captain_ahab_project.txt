First, we're removing a vast bulk of EMF features from the mod in the hopes of achieving a crash-free version
of EMF. Then, the intention is to rapidly add features back into the mix, test for crashes, rinse, and repeat
until crashes are encountered by something added. From there, significantly more drill-down will be necessary,
but this is the best plan that I've got at this point.

( This document is very WIP and will be updating fairly rapidly. )

====== TEST CANDIDATE I ======

Removal / disable log for this version:
- All EMF ambitions have been disabled
- All EMF plots have been disabled
- All EMF & vanilla factions have been disabled through emf_faction_basic_vassal_requirements trigger
- All / almost all CBs cannot be used without forced invocation (via unsafe_war) due to a block upon emf_cb_can_use and friends
- DynLevy (via disabling its on_actions)
- Cadet system (via disabling on_actions)
- emf_dna (lots of nulling out of scripted effect contents, incl. codegen & of course disabling events)
- emf_log on_actions

Results:
