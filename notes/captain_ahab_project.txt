First, we're removing a vast bulk of EMF features from the mod in the hopes of achieving a crash-free version
of EMF. Then, the intention is to rapidly add features back into the mix, test for crashes, rinse, and repeat
until crashes are encountered by something added. From there, significantly more drill-down will be necessary,
but this is the best plan that I've got at this point.

( This document is very WIP and will be updating fairly rapidly. )
